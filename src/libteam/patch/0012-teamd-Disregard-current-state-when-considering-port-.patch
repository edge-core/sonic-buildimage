Subject: [PATCH] teamd: Disregard current state when considering port
 enablement

On systems where carrier is gained very quickly, there is a race between
teamd and the kernel that sometimes leads to all team slaves being stuck in
enabled=false state.

When a port is enslaved to a team device, the kernel sends a netlink
message marking the port as enabled. teamd's lb_event_watch_port_added()
calls team_set_port_enabled(false), because link is down at that point. The
kernel responds with a message marking the port as disabled. At this point,
there are two outstanding messages: the initial one marking port as
enabled, and the second one marking it as disabled. teamd has not processed
either of these.

Next teamd gets the netlink message that sets enabled=true, and updates its
internal cache accordingly. If at this point ethtool link-watch wakes up,
teamd considers (in teamd_port_check_enable()) enabling the port. After
consulting the cache, it concludes the port is already up, and neglects to
do so. Only then does teamd get the netlink message informing it of setting
enabled=false.

The problem is that the teamd cache is not synchronous with respect to the
kernel state. If the carrier takes a while to come up (as is normally the
case), this is not a problem, because teamd caches up quickly enough. But
this may not always be the case, and particularly on a simulated system,
the carrier is gained almost immediately.

Fix this by not suppressing the enablement message.
