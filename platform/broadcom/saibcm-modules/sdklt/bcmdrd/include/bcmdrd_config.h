/*! \file bcmdrd_config.h
 *
 * This config file defines all compilation-time specifications for
 * the BCMDRD.
 *
 * Reasonable defaults are provided for all configuration options
 * where appropriate.
 *
 * You need not edit this file directly to change your configuration,
 * nor is modifying this file advised -- so doing will require
 * manually merging whenever the BCMDRD is upgraded.
 *
 * You should provide your own configuration options or overrides
 * through a combination of:
 *
 *      1. The compiler command line, such as -D{OPTION}={VALUE}
 *
 *      2. Create your own custom configuration file:
 *         a) Create a file called 'bcmdrd_custom_config.h'
 *         b) Define all custom settings, using this file as
 *            the reference
 *         c) Add -DBCMDRD_INCLUDE_CUSTOM_CONFIG to your
 *            compilation
 *         d) Make sure the compilation include path includes
 *            'bcmdrd_custom_config.h'
