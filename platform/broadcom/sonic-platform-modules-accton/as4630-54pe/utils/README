The code for integacting with Accton AS4630-54pe has 2 parts, 
kernel drivers and operational script. 
The kernel drivers of peripherals are under module/ directory.
1.  These drivers are at module dir.
2.  A operational script, accton_as4630_util.py, for device initializatian and 
    peripheral accessing should be installed at /usr/bin. 
    Run "accton_as4630_util.py install" to install drivers.

To initialize the system, run "accton_as4630_util.py install".
To clean up the drivers & devices, run "accton_as4630_util.py clean".
To dump information of sensors, run "accton_as4630_util.py show".
To dump SFP EEPROM, run "accton_as4630_util.py sff".
To set fan speed, run "accton_as4630_util.py set fan".
To enable/disable SFP emission, run "accton_as4630_util.py set sfp".
To set system LEDs' color, run "accton_as4630_util.py set led"
For more information, run "accton_as4630_util.py --help".

====================================================================
Besides applying accton_as4630_util.py to access peripherals, you can 
access peripherals by sysfs nodes directly after the installation is run.

System LED:
    There are 5 system LEDs at the lower-left corner of front panel.
    They are  loc, diag, fan, ps1, and ps2. 
    The sysfs interface color mappings are as follows:
    Brightness:
        0 => off
        1 => green
        2 => amber
        3 => red
        4 => blue
    But not all colors are available for each LED.

Fan Control:
    There are 10 fans inside 5 fan modules.
    All fans share 1 duty setting, ranged from 0~100.

Thermal sensers:
    3 temperature sensors are controlled by the lm75 kernel modules. 

PSUs:
    There 2 power supplies slot at the left/right side of the back.
    Once if a PSU is not plugged, the status of it is shown failed.

There are 48 SFP+ and 6 QSFP modules are equipped. 
Before operating on PSU and QSFP+, please make sure it is well plugged. 
Otherwise, operation is going to fail.
