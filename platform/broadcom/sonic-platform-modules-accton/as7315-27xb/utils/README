To initialize the system, run "accton_as7315_util.py install".
To clean up the drivers & devices, run "accton_as7315_util.py clean".
To dump information of sensors, run "accton_as7315_util.py show".
To dump SFP EEPROM, run "accton_as7315_util.py sff".
To set fan speed, run "accton_as7315_util.py set fan".
To enable/disable SFP emission, run "accton_as7315_util.py set sfp".
To set system LEDs' color, run "accton_as7315_util.py set led"
For more information, run "accton_as7315_util.py --help".

====================================================================
Besides applying accton_as7315_util.py to access peripherals, you can 
access peripherals by sysfs nodes directly after the installation is run.

LED controls can be found under /sys/class/leds. The sysfs interface
color mappings are as follows:
Brightness:
  0 => off
  1 => green
  2 => amber
  3 => red
  4 => blue

There are 5 system LEDs, loc, diag, fan, ps1, and ps2. 
They are lit automatically by CPLD, but the loc and diag.
The loc led has only 1 color, blue.
The diag one has 3 colors: red, amber, and green.

Fan controls can be found in /sys/bus/i2c/devices/2-0066.
There are 10 fans inside 5 fan modules.
All fans share 1 duty setting, ranged from 0~100.

Three temperature sensors are controlled by the lm75 kernel modules. 
They should already be visible under /sys/bus/i2c/drivers/lm75/.

Two power supplies are controlled by the CPLD. 
Here provide their status under
/sys/bus/i2c/devices/10-0050 and /sys/bus/i2c/devices/11-0053.

There are QSFP/SFP modules are equipped. 
Apply "accton_as7315_util.py show" to get their status. 
Apply "accton_as7315_util.py set sfp" to turn on/off light transmission.
Apply "accton_as7315_util.py sff" to dump EEPROM information.
Before operating on that QSFP+, please make sure it is well plugged. 
Otherwise, operation is going to fail.
